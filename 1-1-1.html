        <p>
            The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, 
            was originally a hypertext document management system accessed over the Internet. 
            It has since evolved into the world's dominant software platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), 
            may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, 
            and are published by a software application called a web server.
